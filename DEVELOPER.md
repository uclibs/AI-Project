## IDE:
1. Ruby Mines and VStudio
1. Co-pilot subscriptions
1. Commenting and Debugging
    - Use comments to design your applications

## LLMs:

1. Train the model: Once you have created a project, you need to train the model. This involves feeding the model with a set of training data that includes both input documents and their corresponding subject headings. Annif will use this data to learn the patterns and relationships between the input data and the assigned subject headings.

1. Evaluate the model: After training the model, you should evaluate its performance using a separate set of data. The evaluation data should be similar to the training data, but should not be used during training. Annif provides various metrics to evaluate the performance of the model, such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

1. Use the model: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, you can use it to automatically assign subject headings to new documents. Annif provides various ways to use the model, such as a command-line interface, a web-based interface, or an API.


## Prompting

1. As a ...\
   The first prompt!  

1. Attach a File (Flow Chart, Image,layout, logo, code, requirements)\
   The second prompt (the initial conditions)

1. Debugging
   1.  This code doesn't work.  Help?
   1.  I am encountering an Error. Any ideas why?
   1.  How do I test this?
   1.  Comment this code.
   1.  Is this fast?
   1.  Refactor to make code re-usable and modular.
   1.  Refactor orcing to SOLID principles.
   1.  Can this be cleaner?
   1.  Can you explain the Single Responsiblity Principle?
   1.  Can you explain the Open/Close Principle?

1. Explore
   1.  Can you explain this?
   1.  Can you explain how <function> works in ruby?
   1.  Can you elaborate?
   1.  You focused on positive integers.  Generate a test with odd numbers.
   1.  Write this code like a junior level programmer.
   1.  Can this be re-used?

1. Refactoring Code with AI
   1. Sculpting a final product.
   1. Input broken code through cut and paste or drag and drop.
   1. As a ruby on rails developer, how do I DRY up this code?
   1. Write rspec test for this code.
   1. Write some code for me.
   1. That works, but can it be optimized.
   1. You used recursive, use iterative instead.
   1. Provide a code review focusing on adherence to ruby style guides.



1. Generate a Factorial of a number
   1.  Write python code to generate a factorial of a number.
   1.  Let the user enter the intitial conditions.
   1.  Add windows and graphs to the code with tkinter and mathplot.
   1.  Add a tracetable.
